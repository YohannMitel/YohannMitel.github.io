        My goals : At the end of my Network and Telecommunications diploma I aim to continue my
        studies in the field of computer science to then integrate myself into working life after
        a MIAGE Master at the end of 2026.
        <br/>
        Currently the position that attracts me the most is that of System Administrator.
        Regarding geolocation, I would like to work in Guadeloupe because I always have
        lived there and I plan to return to live there.
        <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuation of studies and conditions : I intend to do a Master MIAGE which means IT methods applied to business management and take the network and information systems course, I wish
        pursue this master's degree at the University of Haute Alsace which is located in Mulhouse, I am aiming for this master's degree, because I see it as a follow-up to the Network and Telecommunications diploma which will
        allow me to strengthen my skills to be able to administer large networks, this training lasts 2 years
      </p>
      <p>
        Admission procedures : It is a selective training course where it is necessary to be a graduate of a training in
        IT and management, diploma + 3 level
      </p>
      <p>
        Strengths and constraints of this training : <br>
        Advantage: A lot of material resemblance with the Network and Telecommunications diploma. <br>
        Disadvantage: I would currently have the same constraints as today which is 2 years of
        further away from my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternative : My plan B is to directly integrate myself into working life after my Network and Telecommunications diploma if I do not
        am not taken in Master MIAGE.
